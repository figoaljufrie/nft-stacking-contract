# NFT Staking Hardhat Project

This project showcases an NFT staking system built with **Hardhat 3 Beta**, using **node:test runner** for tests and **Viem** for Ethereum interactions.

It demonstrates a complete setup including:

- ERC721 NFT collection (`NFTCollection.sol`)
- Staking contract (`NFTStaking.sol`)
- Reward token (`RewardToken.sol`)
- Treasury / reward management contracts (planned)
- Modular folder structure for contracts and tests
- Frontend-ready events and interactions

---

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- Hardhat configuration file for compiling, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests
- TypeScript integration tests using `mocha` and Viem
- Examples demonstrating deployment to local chains and Sepolia testnet
- Modular contracts structure for NFT collection, staking logic, and reward tokens

**NOTES**
- This is my first attempt on entering the web-3 world.
- I have not had any interactions / solo-educations regarding web-3 before this.
- I chose this project to get to know the fundamentals / work-flow / general structures of web-3 world (DeFi, Front-end Integration, dApp implementation, Tokenomics)
- This will be a seperated Repository with my front-end.
- I will attempt on also creating a (very optional / pessimistic, actually.) back-end structure for the off-chain database.
- If there are any notes, advices, or any lecturing sessions that can help me get through this project, kindly hit-me-up or give me a comments.
- I got helped by AI, of course.
